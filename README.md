# Http Binary Mapper

The http binary mapper allows you to create a unique url (along with a basic security token) that executes one or more local binaries.

This package was specifically designed for creating webhook callbacks from services such as [ifttt.com](https://ifttt.com/)

## Setup

1. Download the binary from [releases](https://github.com/benrowe/http-binary-mapper/releases)
2. Rename/Copy `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml`
3. Edit the file. You will need to setup your unique url endpoint (maps.id, security token, and list of binaries to run)
4. Run the application

### Docker setup

_Feature coming soon_
